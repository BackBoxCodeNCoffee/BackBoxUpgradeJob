BackBox 7.0 Add Devices to an Upgrade Job

This project provides example code for how to use BackBox APIs to authenticate to BackBox, select Network and Security infrastructure devices based on IDs from a 3rd party system, select those devices in BackBox, place them in an upgrade job, add an upgrade file to BackBox, and add that file to the upgrade job.
