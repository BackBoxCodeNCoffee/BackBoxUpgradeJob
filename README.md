# BackBox Device OS Upgrade
BackBox 7.0 Add Devices to an Upgrade Job

This project provides example code for how to use BackBox APIs to authenticate to BackBox, select Network and Security infrastructure devices based on IDs from a 3rd party system, select those devices in BackBox, place them in an upgrade job, add an upgrade file to BackBox, and add that file to the upgrade job. 

upgradefile.tgz is a dummy file that is used to demontrate the ability to upload files to BackBox.

Devices_To_Upgrade.csv contains a single column of external device IDs that are used in our code to find the devices we intend to operate on.
